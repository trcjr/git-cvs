add test for --author-file

work around or fix cvsimport's problem that makes --author-file so
fiddly, i.e. it's dumb check for .git to decide whether the -o branch
should exist or be created.

Perhaps at least warn the user if .git exists when --author-file is used?

Blank lines in --commits file will raise "invalid commit"
errors. Filter them out.

Add a '--from' option in cvs_push() as alternative to --commits to
specify commit to start pushing from.
